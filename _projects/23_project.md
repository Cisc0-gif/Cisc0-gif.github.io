As Lead Artist on this 30-week Senior Capstone project, I guided a team of 8 artists, 3D modelers, and animators from pre-production to Alpha release, collaborating closely with narrative, gameplay, and programming teams to define the project’s visual identity. From day one, I set out to establish a visual foundation for our team by designing enemy and environment concept art, reference libraries, and modular designs for our procedural map. Over the first sprint, I focused on grayboxing environments and optimizing lighting; in the second, I prioritized team support—curating resources for animation, UI, and sound—while continuing to iterate on visual polish. By the final sprint, our game featured cohesive lighting across procedurally-generated environments, 4 distinct enemies, 10 unique spell VFX, and a consistent art direction across environments, characters, and UI.

<h2>Q1/Pre-Development Closing Thoughts</h2>
As my first time working with a comprehensive team of talented artists, 3D modelers, and sound designers, closing our 1st 10-week course (as well as pre-development) made me realize this project blossomed into a greater teaching experience than I had first thought it would be. Testing my abilities both as an artist and team lead, this stage of our development has been stressful to meet deadlines, and as I reflect on what's to be improved moving forward I've realized several things:
<ul>
<li>We need a dedicated Level Designer, which would relieve me of my biggest time commitment and allow me to fulfill duties to my team better</li>
<li>Our previous Kanban service changed the limits of their free plan, pulling the rug out from under our team management. We'll be migrating to Airtable between our next 10-week course (Capstone 2nd Quarter).</li>
<li>Regular meetings with Production, Programming, Design, and Narrative leads to address issues more efficiently and improve collaboration between departments.</li>
</ul>
I'm excited to continue development over the following quarter and hopefully gain a better grasp on the pitfalls we experienced in pre-development!
