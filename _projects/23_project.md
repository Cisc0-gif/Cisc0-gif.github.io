As Lead Artist, I directed our team of 8 talented artists, 3D modelers, and animators through pre-production to Alpha release, working closely with narrative, gameplay, and programming teams to shape our project's visual identity. Laying the groundwork for our team of 17, I created environment and enemy concept art early on, along with compiling a library of references for the art team to utilize, and worked closely with narrative and gameplay to craft a rich world for our player's explore. Spending our first 10-week sprint iterating over designs, grayboxing environments, and optimizing our procedural map with Mixed lighting, by the time we hit our second 10-week sprint we were in full development, which is where I prioritized supporting my team as they tackled Animation, Sound Design, and UI using the resources I curated for themâ€”leaving me time to iterate over our work and begin the transition into our polish-phase by the time our third 10-week sprint came around. By the end of our 30-week development cycle, we had a procedurally-generated map at runtime, full progression system, tutorial onboarding, 4 unique enemies, 10 different spells to choose from, and an equippable loot system with over 20 items to collect.

<h2>Q1/Pre-Development Closing Thoughts</h2>
As my first time working with a comprehensive team of talented artists, 3D modelers, and sound designers, closing our 1st 10-week course (as well as pre-development) made me realize this project blossomed into a greater teaching experience than I had first thought it would be. Testing my abilities both as an artist and team lead, this stage of our development has been stressful to meet deadlines, and as I reflect on what's to be improved moving forward I've realized several things:
<ul>
<li>We need a dedicated Level Designer, which would relieve me of my biggest time commitment and allow me to fulfill duties to my team better</li>
<li>Our previous Kanban service changed the limits of their free plan, pulling the rug out from under our team management. We'll be migrating to Airtable between our next 10-week course (Capstone 2nd Quarter).</li>
<li>Regular meetings with Production, Programming, Design, and Narrative leads to address issues more efficiently and improve collaboration between departments.</li>
</ul>
I'm excited to continue development over the following quarter and hopefully gain a better grasp on the pitfalls we experienced in pre-development!
