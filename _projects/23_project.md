<h2>Q1/Pre-Development Closing Thoughts</h2>
As my first time working with a comprehensive team of talented artists, 3D modelers, and sound designers, closing our 1st 10-week course (as well as pre-development) made me realize this project blossomed into a greater teaching experience than I had first thought it would be. Testing my abilities both as an artist and team lead, this stage of our development has been stressful to meet deadlines, and as I reflect on what's to be improved moving forward I've realized several things:
<ul>
<li>We need a dedicated Level Designer, which would relieve me of my biggest time commitment and allow me to fulfill duties to my team better</li>
<li>Our previous Kanban service changed the limits of their free plan, pulling the rug out from under our team management. We'll be migrating to Airtable between our next 10-week course (Capstone 2nd Quarter).</li>
<li>Regular meetings with Production, Programming, Design, and Narrative leads to address issues more efficiently and improve collaboration between departments.</li>
</ul>
I'm excited to continue development over the following quarter and hopefully gain a better grasp on the pitfalls we experienced in pre-development!

<h2>Environment Concepts</h2>
A sample of room layout concepts I made, particularly highlighting the use of verticality and light to both dress and guide players.
