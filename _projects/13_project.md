A 2D physics-based game created over 10 short weeks with a small team of 5 people.

<h2>Concept</h2>
Convergence began as a small gravity prototype developed by my friend <a href="https://piggytek.com/main/">Eric Patrick</a> in his spare time. He saw its potential, and decided to pitch it to our school's Video Game Development Club where he recruited the help of narrative designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adhi-kona-46b663258/">Adhi Kona</a> and experienced programmer <a href="https://davidlh123.itch.io/">David Huynh</a>.

<h2>Mockups</h2>
Early on, I began collecting references from space documentaries and tv shows, and began concepting atmospheric fog and various other effects using Particle Systems which eventually became the cloudy fog you see in the background today. This drove the basis for the concepts you see below.

Once I established a simplistic art style which we all felt could maintain a beautiful composition on screen in the many different arrangments that these sprites would be in (due to the physics-based randomness the gravity mechanic introduced), I began to really hone in on improving the planetary sprites to not be too eye-catching, while also conveying necessary information to players and serving their diegetic purpose to drive gameplay.

<h2>Polish</h2>
While all assets only took about the first 3 weeks to make, the rest of development was spent implementing various UI systems, creating and polishing the various VFX throughout the game, and messing with a lot of differnet render values to see how we could maintain a beautiful visual style at various render distances throughout the progression of the game.
