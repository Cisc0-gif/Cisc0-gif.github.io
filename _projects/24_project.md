Taking on the role as UI/UX Design Team Lead at BranchOut, my work consists of organizing weekly team meetings with other designers, performing asynchronous content review through Slack, and work with the product owner to iterate on core mechanics and engagement loops based on user feedback.
Some of my recent design work involved redesigning our website to recreate our mobile experience for web, requiring high standards for consistency while exploring dynamic layouts.

Working in Figma, my workflow mainly consists of a <strong>grayscale blockout</strong> to highlight key information and interactables followed by our first round of weekly content review. After applying feedback, I proceed with <strong>basic color schemeing, additional effects, and placeholder images</strong> to present a production-level asset at our next round of content review. Finally, I finish applying final comments and we present our work at the end of the week, applying any additional feedback before passing along to the engineering team for implementation.
See below for some examples of my workflow.
