As UI/UX Design Team Lead at BranchOut, my responsibilities include organizing weekly design meetings, conducting asynchronous content reviews via Slack, and collaborating with the product owner to refine core mechanics and engagement loops based on user feedback.
One of my recent projects involved redesigning our website to mirror the mobile experience, ensuring consistency while exploring dynamic layouts.

<h3>Design Workflow</h3>
Utilizing Figma, my design process involves:
<ul>
<li>Creating grayscale wireframes to emphasize key information and interactive elements.</li>
<li>Conducting weekly content reviews to gather feedback.</li>
<li>Applying color schemes, effects, and placeholder images to develop production-ready assets.</li>
<li>Finalizing designs based on feedback before handing them off to the engineering team for implementation.</li>
</ul>

Below are some examples showcasing this workflow:

  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/BranchOut/branchout_workflow_figma.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/BranchOut/branchout_workflow_figma_02.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
