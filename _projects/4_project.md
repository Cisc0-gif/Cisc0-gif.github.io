I created "Going Light." in 2023, during a time when I was going through a personal journey of digital minimalism. Struggling to reclaim a balance of mental and physical health in my first year of college, I had begun looking back on the countless hours I had spent in Middle and High School on my phone and realized I needed to pull away from the addictive qualities of social media and mobile gaming to refocus my energy into more creative outlets and improve my skills as an artist.

I called the website "Chapterhouse." after the Christian-inspired buildings often attached to cathedrals. They were purposefully built to house information and hold private conversations, things that I thought symbolically appropriate to improving humanity: information and conversation.
