I created "Going Light." in 2023, during a time when I was going through a personal journey of digital minimalism. Struggling to reclaim a balance of mental and physical health in my first year of college, I had begun looking back on the countless hours I had spent in Middle and High School on my phone and realized I needed pull away from the addictive qualities of social media and mobile gaming to refocus my energy into more creative outlets and improve my skills as an artist and an author.

A chapter house or chapterhouse is a building or room that is part of a cathedral, monastery or collegiate church in which meetings are held. When attached to a cathedral, the cathedral chapter meets there.

I called the website "Chapterhouse." after the Christian-inspired buildings often attached to cathedrals. They were purposefully built to house information and hold private conversations, things that I thought symbolically appropriate to improving humanity in general: information and conversation.
